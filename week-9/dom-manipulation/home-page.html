<!-- Add your reflection here -->
<!--What did you learn about the DOM?-->

<!--=> I learned how JS can be paired with HTML to change style or-->
<!--=> to create events. -->

<!--What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?-->

<!--=> It really helps to have an editer that can pop up attributes-->
<!--=> There were a few times where we knew we weren't doing the right thing-->
<!--=> because we weren't getting the text editor to pop up to finish your code. -->
<!--=> It also helps to have a preview of the page running to see if what you did is -->
<!--=> working or changes what you expect to change. -->
