#1.6 Your Website, Part 1

##Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

##Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Creating a new repository on github is fairly straightforward. You click the little
"+" sign at the top of the page next to your profile picture. You will then give
a name to the new repo and select whether you want the repo to be public/private
and select a license for the repo as well. Then click the create button and you're
all set.

To clone the repo on your local computer is also straightforward. You will copy the
url on the repo page on github. Then you will go to your command line interface and
use `cd` commands to navigate to the folder or location you would like to store the
repo. Then you will use the command `git clone <paste url here>`. The repo is now
cloned to your computer.

##Describe what open source means.

If a block of code is open source it means it is free and availavle to the public.
Anyone can use the code, modify the code, or distribute the code. 

##What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I would start off by saying I don't think there is such a thing as uptopia, or at 
least a reality that is achievable. 

Open source certaintly has its uses and advantages. It is much more flexible 
because it isn't tied to anything. You can do whatever you want with it. You can use
it as is or expand on it or whatever you wish. Making it open source also allows
many different people to see it which brings in other perspectives, and extra sets
of eyes to catch bugs or problems. 

The fact that you and everyone else can see it and use it means anyone who wants
to do improper things with it can also see it or use it. If there is a problem 
with the code that leaves users vulnerable, someone who would want to exploit it 
has access to the code if they are good enough to find it. 

It doesn't make me nervous or protective. It has its place in the community and 
it's a great place for cultivating ideas and creating that sort of collabrative 
environment is always good for the community.

##Assess the importance of using licenses.

Without licenses people would not be able to open source their code and still
get credit for the work they did. Licenses protect the person that created the code
and decided to open source it to allow them to recognized in the community for 
their work. It also protects the person that created and open-sourced the code 
from being responsible for what is done with the code. If someone decides to take
the open source code and modify it or use it to commit nefarious acts, the person who originally
made the code would not be responsible. The license also states what the user of
the open source code is allowed to do with it. It explains what they are free to do
to distribute, use, modify, etc. to the code they have gotten a hold of. 

The final thing that I believe is very important is licenses must be passed along.
Meaning if someone creates a project using open souce code that has a license then they
must include the same open source license with their code. I prevents someone from
coming across useful code that someone else created and just copying it, doing nothing 
or something to the code, and then selling their code as if it wasn't open source. 

##What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

Using the git commands just once more never hurts. The staging process is becoming clear
to me. The constant usage of `git status` is becoming a habit. 

##Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I did not feel I needed additioanl resources. The link provided to Smash magazine
gave the reader a good understanding of what common licenses do and how they relate
to the open source community. The concept of open source itself is relatively easy
to understand.
