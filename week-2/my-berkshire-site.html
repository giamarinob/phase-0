  - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    
    It is certaintly very rewarding. It goes deeper than that I think. It's one thing
    to be able to put the code in and getting something out. It doesn't exactly
    look right because we haven't yet learned to integrate javascript and css. The real
    joy for me, at this point in my learning, is being able to view source info on
    pages that I've frequented for years and being able to understand how the page is designed.
    LIke I said previously, I don't quite understand what all the javscript and css is,
    but I understand the overall layout and I understand the basic elements of the html
    code. That is the stuff that brings a smile to my face. 
  
  - How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  
    One of the nice things about Cloud 9 and their editor is that is automatically
    closes tags for you if the tag is supposed to be closed which makes it easier 
    to move through the tags and make sure you're using them properly. The Hathaway
    website itself looks pretty simple. The most interesting thing about making the website
    in HTML is hwo easy it really is to "go down the rabbit hole". You can mix and match 
    even basic tags to create ever more intricate structure and making sure to timebox
    and keep it to an hour can be difficult; not because the challenge itself is all
    that difficult, but because of how easy it is to get carried away. 
  
  - How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
    
    It wasn't too difficult, but we did need to focus on not using HTML workarounds
    where css is appropriate. We needed to avoid, and at one point deleted, using the <h1>
    tags to change font size or using style tags in html to change font size. 
    
  - What seems good and bad about HTML?
    
    I don't know if I've come to an understanding about HTML to decide what parts are
    good and bad. Everything needs context. The context of HTML is that it was originally
    designed to do simple text pages. It wasn't designed to do all the fancy stuff
    you see today on the web. Those functions have been brought about by the integration
    of other languages, i.e. css, javascript, etc. I see the function of HTML as
    more of a foundational attribute to web design. As with any other discipline the 
    purpose of the foundation is to provide a basic structure from which complicated
    designs can flow from. In that context I'm not sure there is anything to add
    about whether there is good or bad about HTML. It serves a specific and important
    role in the web design process. 
    
  - What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  
    I admit I don't have any tricks. It is pure memorization. I write it down 
    and I don't forget it.
