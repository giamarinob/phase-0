##What are the 6 phases of WebDesign?

The six phases are as follows; Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, 
Testing and Delivery, and Maintenance. 

Information gathering refers to what is the purpose of the website. Who is your target 
audience, and what is your content going to be. 

Planning has to do with getting an idea for the website before you start writing 
code. This usually takes the form of site maps, or other visual layouts to get 
an idea of what you want the website to look like. 

Design is axiomatic. This is the step where you actually design the website. You 
decide on actual visual features and create a wireframe. You are still probably not
writing code at this point. 

Development is the step where the html and css code is laid down to develop the
site. You implement the design features you picked out in the previous step.

Testing and Delivery is the step where functionality is tested. Do the links work?
Does everything come out like you had designed it? This is also the step where it
is important to get feedback on anything regarding the site. 

Maintenance can be a bit of an open ended step. This is a phase of continuous improvement.
If standards change or links go dead or other changes need to be made after the 
site has been released occur here. 

##What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary goal of my webiste is to showcase my development through DBC and generally
get to know me as a person. The site will feature blogs that I've written, stuff I've
worked on or am working on etc.

##What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

The target audience will be interested in getting to know me. The site will address
this by having content to faciliate that objective. 

##What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

Primarily the user will be looking for information. Information about who I am and
what I am about. The site will also have ways to get in contact with me directly
should they have the desire. 

##What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

The main thing that should be known about user experience is that it's important.
Very important. The user experience can literally make or break your website. They
should also be aware that user experience is not the same as usability. Usability
is certainly part of the overall user experience, but it doesn't end there. 

##What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

The UX design experience is a process of enhancing a website. It ultilizes usability
as well as accesability to increase the pleasure of the user while interacting with 
the webiste. This is valuable because the user experience will be an incredibly important
factor on whether a user comes back to the website, and, ultimately, how succesful the
website will be. 

##Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I did not find anything tedious about the challenge.
