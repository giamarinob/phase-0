##What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a visual representation of a website. It gives a skeletal outline
of the visual layout of the website.

##What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireframes are beneficial because creating a visual representation of the website
allows one to focus the programming from the start. If you know what sort of 
items you want and where they are located it makes it easier to code. You can also
make changes to a wireframe rather easily which, again, allows you to focus on
a specific section of code to modify to reflect those changes. Also, being able
to have a visual representation allows the developer to see the website as a
user would see it which will allow the developer to make the site more user friendly.

##Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I stuck with my initial wireframes simply due to time. However, I will probably play
around with them as I develop my blog site. 

##What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

The most important resources were the help menu of the wireframing tools. Just understanding
what all the options are for and when they're appropriate is a battle in and of itself. 

##Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I wouldn't say I enjoyed wireframing in as much I understand its importance. As the websites
we develop become more and more complex, and even as we learn to implement the
layouts that we create, the process of wireframing will become less tedious. That is
to say, when we start using wireframing in our design process instead of wireframing
for its own sake, which is the purpose of this challenge, it's importance and relevance
will become clearer.
