          Git is a very useful tool to track the changes you make. By utilizing version
          control, git makes it easy to see the history of a file through the various
          snapshots that are taken each time a file is edited. You can do this by 
          through commits. Commits are an action or collection of actions that are taken        to modify a file. Then those actions are committed, the current version as
          well as the previous versions are available to view. It allows you to see
          what you've changed throughout the history of the file.
        </p>

          While you're in the terminal and making changes, git status is a useful
          command to show you what, if any, files have been modified or are untracked.
          It also tells you what you need to do to move those files to a commit or what        the next stage is for those files.

          When writing CSS code, we use the property 'display' which helps determine how an element is displayed on the page. From here, we specify whether we want whatever we're styling to be inline, block, or inline-block and with proper syntax looking like this: [display: inline;] or [display: inline-block;].
        </p>
        <p>
          Visually, when displaying an inline element, it won't look like much, but having multiple elements together, you'll see they are viewed next to one another. This is because an inline element does not affect anything but what's between the tag itself.

  What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  
    For staters the baics. HTML, body, head, title etc. You need these to even get the 
    code to validate, so I end up using them all the time. P is another obvious one
    since just about all generic text content goes through the P tag. The h# tags are used
    a lot as well because having titles and headers is important as well.
  
    We ended up selecting section tags for the blog sections we used which was a tag
    neither I nor my pair had used before. 
  
  How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
  
    As far as how a page flows it would be from left to right, top to bottom. As far as displaying the code,
    the browser, I'm guessing now, goes through layers. It creates the html page then puts in the childeren of html 
    then goes through each child and looks for its childeren and so on and so forth.
  
    I admit I'm not really sure what the question is asking. 
  
  What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
  
    I used Cloud 9 so I didn't use the sublime snippet format. I did follow along with my pair, however, and took note of the process so when I get onsite and am not
    cloud 9 I will know how to add snippets to sublime as necessary.
