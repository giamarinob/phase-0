##How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

When using Google Chromeon windows, all one needs to do is right click on a page and select
inspect. It is very easy, and the interface is very easy to work with as well. 

##How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

When you're in the DEV Tool you can click on an element line and it will bring
up all the styling that is being done to that element. You can go in and type
new styling elements, in this case sizing, or you can give new values to existing
styling elements. You can also simply uncheck the box for existing styling elements
to remove that styling.

##What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Static is the default positioning value. The static value will place an element in
a default postion relative to it's parent element. 

The absolute value will place an element in relation to the first parent element that
does not have a static position value. If there isn't an element that qualifies then
the element is placed relative to the html document. 

The relative position places an element in the position it would have had if the position
value was static.

The fixed position keeps the element in the same spot on the screen even when the 
page is scrolled. 

The values are easy enought to use, but my problem is I do not understand the difference
between relative and static. It seems to me that those two values do the exact same thing.
Perhaps I need to see more complicated html files to see the difference. That is to say,
in simple examples like the one codecademy presents does not properly show the difference
between static and relative. 

##What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

These are just relating to different parts of an element. The padding is the space
between an element and its border. A border is the space between an element's padding
and its margin. The margin is the space between an element's border and the next element's
margin. 

##What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

The challenge was fun and simple. I had no idea you could do those types of things 
before this challenge. It is really helpful becuase you can see what changing 
the styling will do without actually affecting the the document itself because when
you refresh the page everything goes back to the way it was.
